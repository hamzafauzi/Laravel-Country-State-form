# Laravel-Country-State-form

Myphpadmin database and table created. All those files are in Data1 folder. Rename it to Data and save it in mysql php xamp folder


A form is created, Country is selected from the country table

country id is stored in user table from country table

State table is also created.

Once the country is selected from the EDIT FORM the state displays which matches the country id.

Eg if UK is selected so london, etc will show up as it matches that country id 


Read the code to understand it better

All country and State realtions are with IDs

Laravel@2000 is the db file
